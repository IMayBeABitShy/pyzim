# Examples

This directory contains various examples for `pyzim`. Please not that `pyzim` (`python-libzim` on PyPI) needs to be installed first. Please see the main README for details.

## List of examples

The following examples are provided:

- `info.py`: print header and metadata of a ZIM file.
- `read.py`: read an entry from a ZIM file, printing entry metadata (e.g. url) and content.
- `iter.py`: Iterate over all entries in the ZIM file, printing their titles.
- `web.py`: Use `bottle` to serve the content of a ZIM file with a very simple webserver.
